# exam_app

A new Flutter project.



To Run the App
 > open Emulator for the Android or IOS (Note I can't test IOS because I'm using a windows PC i don't have any access to a MAC pc)
 > run the app 

 - the app will show a list of Person with his/her Name, Email and Image. 
NOTE: The Image doesn't contain anything that's why I decided to just put it as a text.

 - upon clicking each tile is will open a new page that will show the complete details of the person.

 > for web just run the app no need to open a browser.
